## General Info

Tier Fortress is a browser based web application which allows users to rank the viability of items in the game Team Fortress 2. The site displays the user's rating for each item and the average rating of all users for each item in a clean UI. The user also has the option to filter the items by classes, equip slots, and can order the items in ascending and descending alphabetical or rating order. Although the site is fully functional to  users who are signed out of Steam, their ratings are not stored in the database and are not counted towards the average.
